                                At Salisbury University I was lucky enough to go on school trips where our class got to
                                participate in environmental research. During this time I completed basic and advanced
                                training for the Army and began attending training for the guard while pursuing my
                                degree in biology. After learning more about bioinformatics in my classes I became
                                interested in learning how to code. I started with a tutorial in C++ for creating a
                                simple game of pong and later found myself wanting to transition to a new major in
                                Computer Science. I applied to enroll at West Virginia University where I would start my
                                new major and study to become a software engineer. </p>

                                sophmore in highschool, I was taking AP science courses, was the saxophone section
                                leader of the marching band, and competed in gymnastics and track. Science and computer
                                labs were some of the highlights of my school days where our classes got to do exciting
                                hands on activities. By the end of highschool I decided to apply to Salisbury University
                                in Maryland to pursue a degree in Biology and enlist in the Army National Guard. </p>

                                allowed me to explore my interests in science and technology where imagination and
                                curiosity fuled the fun activities and adventures that helped to shape my passions. By
                                the time I was in elementary school, I was begging my parents for a microscope and a
                                computer for my room. I would go out into the backyard and look for samples for my
                                slides, build crazy “inventions” with my sister out of the junk we could find, make home
                                projects on my windows 2000 computer, and never stop talking about my love for video

                        installing fixtures while effectively communicating with the workers on site.

                <h4>TEXT-BASED GAME</h4>
                <h5>INTERACTIVE FICTION USING INFORM 7</h5>
                <p>Go Down Together is a short, text-based adventure game programmed using the Inform 7 programming
                    language.
                    The game was created to serve as a quick activity for an album review club.
                    It’s based off of the song Go Down Together from the album Draw Down the Moon by Foxing.
                    The game is set in an apocalyptic world where the player is encouraged to make the most out of the
                    time
                    they have left.
                    The gameplay focuses on careful decision making, ending on the 8th turn.

                    The ship bounces in a circular pattern while the background uses a warp speed effect, much like an old screensaver. 
                    The program was created using the Processing language (java) and IDE.
