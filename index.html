        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>My name is Kiersten Mikulsky. I am a computer science student at West Virginia University
            and an aspiring software engineer. I love to play games and write code. I have pet bugs and a cat
            named cereza that loves to talk. This is where I will put an interesting bio that shows
            off who I am as well as my personality. I haven't really decided what I want to do with a picture
            yet.

                        As a kid I was as inquisitive as I was creative. Growing up in Frederick, Maryland allowed me to explore my interests in science and technology where imagination and curiosity fuled the fun activities and adventures that helped to shape my passions. By the time I was in elementary school, I was begging my parents for a microscope and a computer for my room. I would go out into the backyard and look for samples for my slides, build crazy “inventions” with my sister out of the junk we could find, make home projects on my windows 2000 computer, and never stop talking about my love for video games.  </p>

                        I later moved to Smithsburg where I went to middle and highschool. By the time I was a sophmore in highschool, I was taking AP science courses, was the saxophone section leader of the marching band, and competed in gymnastics and track. Science and computer labs were some of the highlights of my school days where our classes got to do exciting hands on activities. By the end of highschool I decided to apply to Salisbury University in Maryland to pursue a degree in Biology and enlist in the Army National Guard. </p>

                        At Salisbury University I was lucky enough to go on school trips where our class got to participate in environmental research. During this time I completed basic and advanced training for the Army and began attending training for the guard while pursuing my degree in biology. After learning more about bioinformatics in my classes I became interested in learning how to code. I started with a tutorial in C++ for creating a simple game of pong and later found myself wanting to transition to a new major in Computer Science. I applied to enroll at West Virginia University where I would start my new major and study to become a software engineer. </p>

                        I spent 6 yrs in the Army while attending both Salisbury and WVU. During my time in the service I got to travel to different locations in the US for training, work with special forces, and help the community. The military taught me discipline, leadership, and how to work best with a team. </p>

I worked on a variety of projects for school including my capstone where my team built an autonomous wheelchair for the elderly. Today I am a senior computer science student at West Virginia University with less than a few credits to go until graduation.  </p>
